To add a Bootstrap in a file there can be two ways:
```
1.Using the CDN links   
    CDN links to be added in the head section of the index file.

    CSS-->	https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
    JS-->   https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
  ```
  ```  
2.Another way is to use the bootstap is the download the CSS file of Bootstrap and made a Style.css file and add the downloaded material in that file. 
finally link that  style.css file in the head tag.
```
